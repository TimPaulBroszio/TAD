Analysis of newspaper coverage on Nord Stream 2 and arms supply to Ukraine.


The repository includes the script for analysing the newspaper articles on Nord Stream 2 and arms deliveries to Ukraine. 

In addition to the script, the two corpora are made available. 

Nord Stream 2 corpus: "Corpusgesamt.rda

Corpus Arms Supplies to Ukraine: "UkraineCorpus.Rda"

The corpora must be copied into the working directory and then loaded via file.choose() and load(). Afterwards, the analysis steps themselves can be followed. Since the corpora have already been constructed, the tokenisation (data pre-processing) can be started directly.
